      <h2>1. Onigiri</h2><br>
      <p>Like the sandwich could be considered the original portable food of British cuisine, 
        the onigiri rice ball is the original portable food of Japan.<br>
        
        Also known as omusubi, nigirimeshi, or just rice balls,
         onigiri are portions of Japanese rice, normally with a filling in the centre,
         that have been moulded into triangular or cylindrical shapes before being wrapped in nori seaweed.<br>
        
        Onigiri have been enjoyed in Japan for hundreds of years, 
        and most Japanese convenience stores nowadays sell a great range of onigiri for 100-150 yen (£0.75-£1.12) a piece. 
        Popular onigiri fillings include umeboshi pickled plums, seasoned seaweed, tuna mayonnaise, and teriyaki chicken.</p>

            <h2>2.Ramen</h2><br>
              
            <p>Ramen is a noodle soup dish consisting of wheat noodles (also known as ramen noodles),
                a savoury broth (soy sauce, salt, miso, and tonkotsu pork bone are the four main ramen broth bases) and 
               toppings of meat, protein, and/or vegetables such as sliced pork,
                nori seaweed, spring onions, bamboo shoots, and others.<br>
               
               Ramen is one of present-day Japans absolute favourite delicacies,
                costing very little and being widely available in restaurants and ramen bars
                (which are on almost every street corner).
                Indeed, Japanese ramen is so popular that there is a ramen-themed museum/amusement park in Tokyo.</p>

    <h2>3. Takoyaki</h2><br>
     
    <p>As far as Japanese street vendor foods are concerned, few are more notorious than takoyaki.
        Also known as octopus balls or octopus dumplings, 
       this delicacy is cooked using a special hot plate with rows of half-spherical moulds. 
       Each of the moulds is filled with a savoury batter mixture
        before a bite-size piece of tako octopus meat is inserted into the middle. 
       The takoyaki are turned with a pick or skewer every minute or so to ensure an evenly-cooked outside and 
       a perfect ball-shaped dumpling in the end.<br><br>
       
       Takoyaki are typically served in lots of six, eight or ten, 
       brushed with a sweet/savoury takoyaki sauce and topped with mayonnaise, aonori seaweed and 
       katsuobushi bonito fish flakes.</p>

            <h2>4. Sushi</h2><br>
             
            <p>Sushi is one of the first foods that spring to mind when we think about Japanese cuisine. 
              This delicacy was one of the first Japanese dishes to be exported to the US 
              after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and since then its popularity has steadily increased year after year.<br>
              
              The word sushi refers to any dish made with Japanese rice that has been seasoned with rice vinegar.
               Common varieties of sushi include makizushi (sushi rice and fillings rolled up in nori seaweed),
               nigiri sushi (shaped, bite-size mounds of sushi rice with single slices of raw fish or similar draped over the top) and 
              inarizushi 
              (sushi rice stuffed inside pockets of inari; a type of seasoned, fried tofu).<p>
